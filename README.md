# About Unit-4-Game

This is an RPG game based on the show Arrested Development where you pick a character with a certain amount of hit points (HP) and attack points (AP). You must defeat the the three other characters before your HP go down to 0. Your AP will go up by a multiplier as the game goes on, but so will your enemy's.
